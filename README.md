# AIForOmicsDataAnalysis
Repository for the Artificial Intelligence for Omics Data Analysis project, a.a. 2022/2033

The purpose of the project is analyze gene expression data for tumour classification, by selecting the most relevant genes for single tumour and for all tumours.

Project Workflow:
- Dataset analysis and cleaning;
- Use supervised and unsupervised methods for tumour classification, with and without samples balancing using at least 2 different methods and motivating their choice; 
- Features reduction and relevance

The dataset is available at the following link UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Gene expression cancer RNA-Seq Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq)
